# Turbolinks Example

A [Turbolinks](https://github.com/turbolinks/turbolinks) web app built using [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/). It's lightening fast!!!

## Usage

First install dependencies:

    $ npm install

Run the app locally with:

    $ npm start

Then browse to: [`http://localhost:1234`](http://localhost:1234)

Open the browser's dev tools and you should see a console log showing Turbolinks has loaded. Then open the network timings pane, navigate between the pages and bask in awe at the sheer speed.

Turbolinks gives you the SPA effect without the complexity of an SPA. Enough said.
