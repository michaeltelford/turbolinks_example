# Turbolinks Example

A [Turbolinks](https://github.com/turbolinks/turbolinks) web app built using Parcel. It's lightening fast!!!

## Usage

First install dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

Build and run the app with:

    $ npm run build && cd dist && serve

Then browse to: `http://localhost:5000/`

Open the browser's dev tools and you should see a console log showing turbolinks has loaded. Then open the network timings pane and navigate between the pages and bask in awe at the speed.

Turbolinks gives you the SPA effect without the complexity of an SPA. Enough said.
